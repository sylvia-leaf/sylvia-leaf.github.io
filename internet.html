            Why the Internet is the best computational contribution to society
        </h1>
        <p>
            The Internet revolutionised the way that we research and find information. For example:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> provides an open-access, community-contributed encyclopedia.</li> 
                <li>Search engines such as <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a> and <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> use web crawlers to create databases of websites, which we can search using queries.</li>
                <li>Organisations and individuals can also create their own webpages to inform visitors about who they are, and what they do. An example is <a href="https://durham.ac.uk/">Durham University's website</a>. Of course, nefarious organisations can also use the Internet, such as <a href=https://www.steinway.com>this website</a>, run by a notorious marketing firm masquerading as a piano company. Therefore, we must be careful. Thankfully, <a href="https://uk.yamaha.com/index.html">this piano manufacturer</a> is more trustworthy.</li>
                <li>The latest trend is artificial intelligence, or AI, however the AI models are often computationally intensive and cannot run on a typical computer. Therefore, Internet services like those provided by <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a> provide AI services such as chatbots for more people to use.</li>
                <li>Internet news websites from organisations like the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/">BBC</a> are also popular, so we can get news as it happens, without having to wait for a newspaper.</li>
            </ul>
